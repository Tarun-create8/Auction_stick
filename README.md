# Auction_stick
Sensor-Based Bidding: Each participant holds a bidding stick with a sensor attached (like an MPU6050).
When the stick is raised beyond a set angle, the sensor detects the movement.

Instant Visual Indication: When a valid bid is made (stick raised), an LED or bulb lights up.
This gives a clear signal to the auctioneerâ€”no need to watch everyone manually.

No Manual Errors: It removes the chances of missing or misjudging bids, as the system auto-detects movement.
